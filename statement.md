Problem Statement:Traditional manual methods of booking airline tickets and calculating total travel costs (including add-ons like food and excess                           baggage) are time-consuming, prone to calculation errors, and difficult to manage efficiently. There is a need for an automated software                   solution that streamlines the passenger registration process, provides dynamic pricing based on travel class, and accurately aggregates                    ancillary costs into a final invoice.
