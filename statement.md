#Problem Statement:
Traditional manual methods of booking airline tickets and calculating total travel costs (including add-ons like food and excess                           baggage) are time-consuming, prone to calculation errors, and difficult to manage efficiently. There is a need for an automated software                   solution that streamlines the passenger registration process, provides dynamic pricing based on travel class, and accurately aggregates                    ancillary costs into a final invoice.

#Scope of the Project:
Customer Registration: Securely capture and store passenger details (Name, Address, Journey Date, Source, and Destination) into a persistent database (pdata table).

Class Selection & Fare Calculation: Allow users to view available travel classes (First, Business, Economy) and calculate ticket prices based on the number of passengers.

In-Flight Services Management:

Display a dynamic food menu fetched from the database.

Allow users to select multiple food items and calculate the total catering cost.

Baggage Handling: Provide a mechanism to calculate fees for excess luggage based on weight.

Comprehensive Billing: Generate a final bill that aggregates the base ticket fare, food charges, and luggage fees into a single total amount.

Data Persistence: Ensure all static data (Menu prices, Class rates) and dynamic data (Passenger info) are managed via a MySQL database connection.

Airline Counter Staff / Ground Operations Crew, Offline Travel Booking Agents, System Administrators / Database Managers.
